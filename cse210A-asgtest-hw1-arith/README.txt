How to run:

	- In the root folder, run "make clean" to remove all previous builds, then run "make" to 
	  create an executable file called "arith" in the root folder. 

	- To run the tests, you can just directly run ./test.sh which creates the exec file and 
	  runs it against the tests.

        * arith.py is located inside the "tests" folder.
 
	* There are 9 custom test cases added to the tests folder.
